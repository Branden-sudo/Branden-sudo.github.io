        What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we idealized for courage.
        Heroes does what we should have been done when no one is willing to step up. Therefore, who we select as
        role models says a lot about who we are as people.
    </p>
    <p>
        The heroe that I have selected has the following characteristics:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Valiant spirit of self-sacrifice in the face of the fanatic opposition - At great risk of his life, his great personal valor and courageous initiative were in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service. </li>
        <li>Motivate others - Relentlessly pursued the Marine Corp to allow him to return to his brothers on the battle field leaving behind his new wife safty of being state side.</li>
        <li>Sacrifice - Knowing what he could lose returning back to war, he kept true to the Brotherhood Resulting in his demise on  February 19, 1945</li>
        <li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
    </ul>
   
        <br>
        Marine are known for being always faithful; for never giving up; for being hard-chargers. Perhaps no Marine better exemplified these traits than Gunny Basilone, the only enlisted Marine in World War II (WWII) to be awarded both the Medal of Honor and Navy Cross and a true Marine Corps legend.
