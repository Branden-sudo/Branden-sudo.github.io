            In a time of having to distance ourselves from others it can be hard to feel like we can do something of impact or meaningful. So how when we are told to be distant can we as one or two people make a difference in someoneâ€™s life?

            TIt feels like an eternity past when things first shut down, we were told to stay home and wear a mask when out, remember scrambling to find a face covering? My wife and I do, My wife especially. She is an accomplished seamstress and just before stores closed there doors she decided to make a run for fabric so she could make masks for our family, while in line to get fabric cut an elderly woman stood buy the counter sobbing trying to figure out how to hand sew masks for her husband who was on dialyses and previously he had been using 3-4 deposable masks a day, now he had nothing and this woman was struggling to find a way to get him some kind of face covering that a filter could be placed in. Well my wife stepped up and got her email address and offered to sew this woman masks. That night after her encounter my wife could not sleep, she decided to browse Facebook and found a listing of someone selling masks, reading the comments she found desperate parents wives and fathers trying to get masks for immune compromised children or spouses, there were so many people all over who were in need like this woman, maybe there was a way to help others in a time of feeling so alone, but with everything shut down and we our selves counting every penny wondering how we were going to make it, in a bold move my wife decided that such a necessity should not be charged for.
